# Domain lists

This is (sorta) fork of [NextDNS GAFAM domain list](https://github.com/nextdns/gafam).
I maintain this list... just for fun (tm).

I ended up with extra domains, and extra entities with this list, for example Korean Big Tech (TM) like [Kakao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakao) or [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver_Corporation).

## Where do you use it?

Download the nextdns log, and count percentage of each entities.
(NextDNS list is quite inaccurate, and doesn't count Korean entities, so...)

## Copyright

I don't think these simple list of domain names are copyrightable, but this is originally created by NextDNS and they don't have license specified, so I dunno.
Anyways, all files outside `data` directory is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported. (I deliberately avoided CCL version 4. Don't ask me about it.)

In certain jurisdictions (ie. South Korea), `database rights` are a thing;
and to deal with those jurisdictions, [Open Database License (link to summary)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) is applied on `data` directory.
